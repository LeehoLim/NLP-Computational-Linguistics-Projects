3.4

We see that when the initial transition states have a tendency to bunch up closer together and are more even (i.e. closer to 50/50), they tend to have a larger plog, or a smaller probability, and have learned less about English than those that start in some more skewed state (i.e. closer to 100/0 or 0/100…). In that event, we see that we tend to have a smaller blog, or a larger probability, which indicates that when randomized at these transition probabilities with greater discrepancies, the HMM has learned more English. Notice that although we do not output a concrete “grid”, we may visualize the presented data by this noticeable trend. I.E. When we have a lower plog sum value, this indicates that we have a higher probability assigned to the words in our corpus.

Therefore, for the 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9 we see that the more we go inward, the less the HMM understands the English language (0.1, 0.9 being the best learners of the English language, 0.3, 0.7 being the next best, and 0.5 being the worst).
